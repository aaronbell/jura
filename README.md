Jura Font Project by Daniel Johnson (il dot basso dot buffo at gmail dot com)

N.B. The Jura family has an unfortunate name clash with Ed Merritt's Jura serif font,
which may be found [here](http://www.tenbytwenty.com/products/typefaces/jura).

This project is currently in active development by Alexei Vanyashin as part of the Font Improvement project.
This repo contains both original v2.26, and new v3.001 and up Development versions. 

[Jura Design Guideline](documentation/v3.001design-guide.md)

#### Goals of the new v.3 redesign:

- Add more weights
- Refine Cyrillic glyphs
- General design and spacing improvements

These goals will be achieved by drawing new masters and interpolating in-between weights.
